# Nihon-Quest-Demo
Visual novel game made with P5.js that explores the culture of Japan.

Our web hosting platform is very unreliable, so we decided to move the code over to GitHub.

## How to Install and Run Efficiently
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Open index.html in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the Live Server extension. Its icon looks like purple radio waves.
4. There should now be an option to "Go Live" in the bottom right corner of the screen in VS Code. Click it while having index.html open.
5. Enjoy!
